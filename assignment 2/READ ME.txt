Follow the instructions on the IU interface
1. input a sequence of numbers (diveded by space) (!!!!!DO NOT input 0 please)
2. input the operation way (1 - 2^x; 2 - x^2; 3 - sqrt(x); 4 - logx)
3. input the mode (1 - assign uniformly; 2 - 1 number per thread and the rest of the numbers for the last thread)
